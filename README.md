# Regional Infrastructure Resilience Auditor

The Regional Infrastructure Resilience Auditor is a public-sector analytics engineering project that standardizes childcare, youth welfare, and hospital infrastructure data into a unified regional resilience intelligence layer for policy planning.

## Executive Objective

Build a reproducible analytics product that helps policymakers answer:
- Which regions are underserved across childcare, youth services, and hospital capacity?
- Where is capacity growth lagging over time?
- Which regions face increasing near-term service pressure?

## Target Users

- Public-sector analysts
- Regional planning teams
- Non-technical decision-makers using dashboards

## Core Stack

- DuckDB for analytical storage
- dbt for transformations, tests, and snapshots
- Python and SQL for ingestion, normalization, and forecasting
- Airflow for orchestration
- Streamlit/Metabase for dashboarding
- GitHub Actions for CI validation
- GitHub Codespaces for reproducible development

## Documentation Hub (Defense and Watchalong)

Use `docs/docs_index.md` as the primary navigation file.

Key companion docs include:
- phase deep-dives (`docs/phase_0_governance.md`, `docs/phase_1_repository_setup.md`, `docs/phase_2_environment_configuration.md`)
- modeling governance (`docs/grain_definition.md`, `docs/join_strategy.md`, `docs/formula_to_model_mapping.md`)
- source and rules (`docs/source_inventory.md`, `docs/standardization_business_rules.md`)
- stakeholder delivery (`docs/dashboard_question_bank.md`, `docs/thesis_report_outline.md`, `docs/final_handoff.md`)

## Technical Principles

1. Raw data stays raw.
2. Cleaning and normalization are fully reproducible.
3. Business rules are explicitly documented.
4. Transformations are version-controlled.
5. Dashboards must trace back to governed model outputs.

## Quick Start (Codespaces or Local)

1. Open this repository in GitHub Codespaces.
2. Let post-create setup run from `.devcontainer/post-create.sh`.
3. Copy environment template: `cp .env.example .env`.
4. Place source CSV files in `data/raw/`.
5. Build ingestion and transformation layers in `src/` and `dbt/`.
6. Serve dashboard prototypes from `reports/dashboards/`.

For detailed setup and troubleshooting, see `docs/environment_setup.md`.

## Current Implementation Status

- Phase 0 complete: project framing, KPI framework, methodology baseline.
- Phase 1 complete: repository scaffold, folder conventions, Codespaces setup.
- Phase 2 complete: reproducible environment provisioning and dependency manifests.
- Phase 3 complete: source inventory and field-level audit documentation.
- Phase 4 complete: reproducible raw ingestion and validation pipeline in DuckDB.
- Phase 5 complete: dbt initialization, sources, staging models, and baseline tests.
- Phase 6 complete: standardization macros, cleaned staging, and documented business rules.
- Phase 7 complete: dimensions, intermediate metrics, facts, and KPI marts.
- Phase 8 complete: executive overview dashboard batch (D1) and data quality status mart.
- Phase 9 complete: multi-view policy dashboard, storytelling annotations, KPI summary views, and screenshot assets.
